(1/2)*(4/9)*2 = 4/9 chance of picking both same
(1/2)*(5/9)*2 = 5/9 chance of picking both different
(4/9)*1.1 + (5/9)*(-1) = -0.0667

variance = E[X^2] - E[X]^2
	or E[(Xâˆ’E[X])^2].
	or in english the mean squared distance of X from the mean
	((1.1 - (-0.0667))^2)*(4/9) = 0.605
	((-1 - (-0.0667))^2)*(5/9) = 0.484
	.605 + .484 = 1.089
	
q2
	n people selected
	X is indicator random variable
	P(X=1) = 0.6
	
	for any given i
	E(Xi) is 0.6
	Var(Xi) = (.6)*(.4) = 0.24
		
(c)
	E[Y] is the sum of all the E[Xi] for i=0 to i=n hence it is different.
	
(d) due to linearity of expected value E[(1/n)*Y] = (1/n)*E[Y] =
	E[Xi] = 0.6 for any given i since E[Y] = n*E[Xi] 
	

(e)	Var(Xi) = .24
	Var(Y) = n*Var(X) as binomial random variable
	Var((1/n)*Y) = (1/n^2)*Var(Y) =
	(1/n)*Var(X)
	
Q3
	(a) 
		13 balls 5 white 8 red
		P(X1=1) = 5/13
		P(X1=0) = 8/13
		P(X2=1|X1=1) = 4/12
		P(X2=1|X1=0) = 5/12
		P(X2=1) = (5/13)*(4/12)  + (8/13)*(5/12) = 0.385 = 5/13
		P(X2=0|X1=1) = 8/12
		P(X2=0|X1=0) = 7/12
		
		P(X1=1 and X2 =1) = (5/13)*(4/12) = 0.128
		P(X1=1 and X2 =0) = (5/13)*(8/12) = 0.256
		P(X1=0 and X2 =1) = (8/13)*(5/12) = 0.256
		P(X1=0 and X2 =0) = (8/13)*(7/12) = 0.359
		
	(b) No they are not independent
		P(X1=1 and X2=1) = 0.128
		But P(X1=1) = 5/13 and P(X2=1) = 5/13
		(5/13)^2 = 0.148
		Since P(X1=1)*P(X2=1) does not equal P(X1=1 and X2=1) they are not independent
		
	(c) P(X2=1) = 5/13
		P(X2=0) = 8/13
		Bernoulli random variable hence E(X2) = P(X2=1) = 5/13 = .385
		
	(d) Similar logic as q before.
		
		
	(d) P(X2=1|X1=1) = 4/12 = 0.333
